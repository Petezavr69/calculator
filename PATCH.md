# PATCH (Невероятный 2д калькулятор прямо как твоя любимая вайфу 1.1)

many features have been added such as:

- *history of operations*
- *a field in which you can write notes that you can save,to save it, you will need to create in advance text.txt in the same folder where the program is located*

Unfortunately, the problems associated with the mandatory input of numbers in both lines remained, but this does not affect the operation of the program.
The division module has also been fixed, now there are numbers after the dot.

The ability to open your notes will be added soon.
