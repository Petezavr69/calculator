# GLOBAL PATCH (Невероятный 2д калькулятор прямо как твоя любимая вайфу 1.0)

many features have been added such as:

- *hex*
- *oct*
- *bin*
- *square root*
- *fractal of a natural number n*
- *sinus*
- *cosine*
- *tangent*
- *cotangence*
- *arctangent*
- *arccosineus*
- *arccosineus*
- *arccotangens*

Unfortunately, the problems associated with the mandatory input of numbers in both lines remained, but this does not affect the operation of the program.
The division module has also been fixed, now there are numbers after the dot.

And also with the support of my content manager, the function of calling Misato san to the screen was created.
